I had some free time at work this week, so I spent it building this website just for you. I hope you will like it. I made it all with love while thinking about you the entire time. Every photo, every song, every detail is my way of showing you how much I care.

I miss everything about you, and the little moments we share. Every day without you feels so long. I know I hurt you before, and I am really sorry. I never wanted you to feel distant or unsure of my love. Chara, I want you to know that whatever happened before will never happen again. I have settled everything, and now I just want a chance to court you properly and show you the love I have been feeling for you all this time.

I am asking for a second chance, not just to fix what happened, but to prove that I can be someone who makes you feel loved, appreciated, and happy. I want to make you smile, laugh, and feel cherished every single day. I promise to be honest, open, and present, and to show you my heart in the way you deserve.

I am looking forward to seeing you next week, but no pressure, it's up to you if you're gonna show up or not, but I'll still be there waiting for you. I just want to introduce myself to you again with pure honesty, no more secrets, no more doubts, just me showing you my love the way it truly is.

You are one of the most important person in my life now, and I will always cherish and love you. I hope this website, this little world I made for you, can show even a small part of how much I really care for you.
